# Getting Started

The Autonomous Incident Agent (AIA) is a production-grade system that automatically detects, analyzes, and fixes application failures. It connects your observability data with an intelligent agentic loop to resolve incidents without human intervention.

## One-Line Start

If you have already configured your environment, you can start the full AIA stack with a single command:

```bash
bun run start
```

This will launch all services, including the Agent, Router, Autopsy, and Dashboard.

## Core Concepts

Understanding AIA requires identifying its four main stages of operation.

### 1. Detection (Router)

The lifecycle begins when your application emits an error trace via OpenTelemetry. The **Router** service ingests this trace, filters out noise, and identifies it as a distinct incident.

### 2. Analysis (Autopsy)

Once an incident is detected, the **Autopsy** service analyzes the stack trace, local variables, and recent logs. It correlates this data to pinpoint the root cause in the codebase.

### 3. Resolution (Agent)

The **Agent** takes the autopsy report and spins up a reproduction environment. It attempts to:
1.  Create a reproduction script (repro) that fails.
2.  Write a patch to fix the code.
3.  Verify the patch passes the repro and existing tests.

### 4. Delivery (GitHub)

Finally, if the patch is verified, AIA automatically opens a Pull Request in your repository with the fix, the reproduction proof, and a detailed explanation of the change.
