# Tutorial: Netlify Integration

To monitor applications deployed on Netlify, you must configure the environment to send traces to your public AIA endpoint.

## Environment Variables

In your Netlify Site settings (**Build & deploy > Environment**):

*   `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`: `https://your-aia-agent.com/v1/traces`
*   `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME`: `my-netlify-app`

## Netlify Functions

Netlify Functions (AWS Lambda) have short lifecycles. Ensure your OTel SDK flushes data before the function freezes.

### Code Considerations

If using the `instrumentation.node.ts` approach, the auto-instrumentation usually handles this safely. However, if using manual spans, always `await span.end()`.

## Verification

1.  Deploy with `netlify deploy`.
2.  Trigger a function error.
3.  Check the AIA Dashboard.
