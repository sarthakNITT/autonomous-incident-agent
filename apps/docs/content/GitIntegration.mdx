## Branching Strategy

When AIA detects an incident and generates a fix, it follows a strict branching strategy to avoid conflicts.

1.  **Branch Name**: `aia/fix-<incident-id>`
2.  **Commit Message**: `fix: resolve issue <incident-id> (automated)`
3.  **PR Title**: `[AIA] Fix: <Error Description>`

## PR Lifecycle

1.  **Open**: The agent opens the PR with the `aia-generated` label.
2.  **Review**: Developers review the changes and the attached Autopsy Report.
3.  **Merge**: Once approved (and CI passes), the PR is merged into the main branch.
