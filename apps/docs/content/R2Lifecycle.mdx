# R2 Lifecycle Policy

To manage costs and storage size, we enforce Time-To-Live (TTL) policies on the R2 bucket.

## Retention Rules

We categorize objects based on their path prefix and apply the following retention periods:

| Path Prefix | Retention | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `events/` | 7 Days | Raw traces are transient and only needed for immediate analysis. |
| `autopsy/` | 30 Days | Analysis reports are kept for debugging and audit trails. |
| `patches/` | 7 Days | Patches are fleeting; once merged or rejected, they are not needed. |
| `reports/` | Indefinite | High-level PDF/Markdown summaries are permanent records. |

## Implementation

These rules are configured in the Cloudflare Dashboard under your bucket settings > **Lifecycle Rules**.

We recommend creating a rule named `AIA Cleanup` with the above prefixes.
