# Miro Integration

AIA integrates with **Miro** to export incident details as a visual board — perfect for team post-mortems, war rooms, and collaborative troubleshooting sessions.

## Overview

The **"Visualize in Miro"** button on each incident card sends incident data to `/api/miro/create-board`, which creates a new Miro board pre-populated with:

- Incident title and status
- Root cause description
- Step-by-step fix instructions

After creation, a toast notification appears with an **"Open Board"** link to view the Miro board directly.

## How It Works

### API Endpoint

```
POST /api/miro/create-board
```

**Request body:**
```json
{
  "incident_id": "abc123",
  "title": "API 500 Error - /users endpoint",
  "description": "Status: analyzing",
  "root_cause": "Null pointer exception when user record is missing",
  "fix_steps": [
    "Open src/api/users.ts",
    "Add null check after database query",
    "Test with invalid user ID"
  ]
}
```

**Success response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "board_url": "https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVN...",
  "board_id": "uXjVN..."
}
```

### Miro Board Structure

The created board includes sticky notes and frames organized to represent the incident visually — making it easy to share with your team during an incident review.

## Setup

### Environment Variables

<Tabs defaultValue="env">
  <TabsList>
    <div className="flex items-center rounded-[4px] bg-[#18181b] p-0.5 border border-zinc-800/50">
      <TabsTrigger value="env">.env.local</TabsTrigger>
    </div>
    <TabsCopyButton />
  </TabsList>
  <TabsContent value="env">
    ```bash
    MIRO_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_miro_access_token
    ```
  </TabsContent>
</Tabs>

### Getting a Miro Access Token

1. Go to [miro.com/app/settings/user-profile/apps](https://miro.com/app/settings/user-profile/apps)
2. Click **Create new app**
3. Enable the **boards:write** scope
4. Generate an access token
5. Copy the token to your `.env.local`

## Dashboard UI

The Miro button appears on every incident card alongside other action buttons:

```
[Download PDF] [Foxit Report] [Fix with Kilo ⚡] [Cline Pipeline] [Visualize in Miro]
```

While the board is being created, the button shows **"Exporting..."**. Once complete:

- **Success**: Toast with "Incident exported to Miro!" and an **Open Board** action
- **Error**: Toast with the specific error message

## Use Cases

### Post-Mortem Reviews

Export incidents after resolution to document the timeline, root cause, and steps taken — all in a shareable, visual format.

### Live War Room

During an active incident, export to Miro and invite your team to collaborate on analysis and response in real time.

### Incident Reporting

Use Miro boards as visual supplements to PDF reports (generated via Foxit) for stakeholder presentations.
