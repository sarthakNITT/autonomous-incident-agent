# GitHub Integration

AIA integrates with GitHub at the **per-project level** — each project you create in the dashboard has its own GitHub Personal Access Token and repository settings. This means you can monitor multiple repos with different tokens without any cross-contamination.

## Resolution Modes

When you create a project, you choose how AIA handles the fix:

| Mode | What happens |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Auto PR** | AIA clones the repo, applies the AI patch, and opens a GitHub Pull Request automatically |
| **Manual Fix** | AIA shows the root cause, AI fix prompt, and manual steps in the dashboard — no PR created |

You can update the resolution mode at any time from the project settings in the dashboard.

## How It Works

When an incident is detected and analyzed:

1. **Git Service** clones your repository
2. Creates a new branch: `aia/incident-{uuid}`
3. Attempts to apply the AI-generated patch
4. Commits changes (or saves failed patch)
5. Pushes to GitHub
6. Creates a Pull Request with:
   - Root cause analysis
   - AI fix prompt (for copy-paste to AI assistants)
   - Step-by-step manual instructions
   - Patch file (if auto-application failed)

## Setup

### Create a GitHub Personal Access Token

1. Go to [GitHub Settings → Tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
2. Click **"Generate new token (classic)"**
3. Name it (e.g., "AIA Bot")
4. Select scope: **`repo`** (Full control of private repositories)
5. Click **"Generate token"**
6. **Copy the token** (starts with `ghp_`)

### Add Token to Your AIA Project

When creating a project in the AIA dashboard:

1. Enter your **GitHub Repository URL** (e.g., `https://github.com/org/my-app`)
2. Paste your **GitHub Token** into the token field
3. Select your **Base Branch** (AIA fetches available branches automatically)
4. Choose **Resolution Mode**: Auto PR or Manual Fix

The token is stored encrypted and associated only with that project — it is never shared with other projects.

> **For contributors (self-hosting):** Add the token to `.env.local` as `GITHUB_TOKEN` for the development fallback, or use the per-project system via the dashboard UI.


## Pull Request Structure

Each PR created by AIA includes:

### 1. Title
```
fix: resolve incident {incident-id}
```

### 2. Description

**Root Cause:**
AI-generated explanation of what caused the error.

**AI Fix Prompt:**
A detailed, copy-paste ready prompt for AI coding assistants (Cursor, GitHub Copilot, etc.).

**Manual Steps:**
Step-by-step instructions for manual remediation.

**Patch:**
If patch auto-application failed, the patch is saved as `patch_failed_{timestamp}.diff` in the commit.

### 3. Files Changed

- **If patch succeeded**: The actual code changes
- **If patch failed**: `patch_failed_*.diff` file with the patch content

### 4. Branch Name
```
aia/incident-{uuid}
```

## Patch Handling

### Automatic Application

The Git service attempts to automatically apply patches using `git apply`:

```bash
git apply --ignore-space-change --ignore-whitespace patch.diff
```

**Success Rate:** ~40-60% (depends on AI patch quality)

### When Patches Fail

If `git apply` fails:
1. Patch is saved as `patch_failed_{timestamp}.diff`
2. File is committed to the branch
3. PR still created with:
   - AI fix prompt
   - Manual steps
   - Failed patch for reference

**Users can:**
- Use the AI fix prompt with their preferred AI assistant
- Follow manual steps
- Manually apply the patch
- Review and modify the suggested fix

## Token Permissions

The GitHub token needs:

| Permission | Required | Reason |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **repo** | Yes | Clone, push, create PRs |
| **Contents** | (included in repo) | Read/write code |
| **Pull Requests** | (included in repo) | Create and manage PRs |

**Note:** Classic tokens with `repo` scope include all necessary permissions.

## Security Best Practices

### Token Security
- **Never commit** tokens to git
- Store in `.env` (gitignored)
- Use environment variables in production
- Rotate tokens every 90 days

### Repository Access
- Token has access to **all repos** the user owns
- For organizations, use a dedicated bot account
- Limit token to specific repos if possible

### Local Testing
- Use `aia.config.local.yaml` (gitignored)
- Keep production config with PLACEHOLDER values
- Never commit real credentials

## Troubleshooting

### "Repository not found"
- Check `owner` and `repo` in config
- Verify token has access to the repository
- Ensure repository exists

### "Permission denied"
- Token needs `repo` scope
- Check token hasn't expired
- Verify token is correctly set in `.env`

### "Failed to push"
- Check branch doesn't already exist
- Verify network connectivity
- Ensure repository allows pushes

### "PR creation failed"
- Check GitHub API rate limits
- Verify token permissions
- Check repository settings allow PRs

## Example Workflow

1. **Incident detected** → Agent receives error
2. **Autopsy analyzes** → AI generates fix
3. **Git clones repo** → `git clone https://TOKEN@github.com/owner/repo.git`
4. **Create branch** → `git checkout -b aia/incident-abc123`
5. **Apply patch** → `git apply patch.diff` (or save if fails)
6. **Commit** → `git commit -m "fix: resolve incident abc123"`
7. **Push** → `git push origin aia/incident-abc123`
8. **Create PR** → GitHub API call with description
9. **Dashboard updates** → Shows PR link
