# AI Chat Assistant

AIA includes a built-in **AI Chat Assistant** powered by **You.com** that you can use to ask questions about incidents, get fix suggestions, and learn best practices — all without leaving the dashboard.

## Overview

The AI Chat page (`/chat`) provides a conversational interface where you can:

- Ask about your active incidents
- Request help with specific error types
- Get best practices for deployment reliability
- Learn how to reduce incident resolution time

## Accessing the Chat

Navigate to the **Chat** section from the top navigation bar. The chat requires you to be signed in.

## Interface

The chat UI provides:

- **Message history** — Scrollable conversation view with timestamps
- **Role indicators** — Bot icon for AI, person icon for user
- **Suggested questions** — Pre-built prompts shown on first load
- **Rich input** — Press Enter (without Shift) or click Send

### Suggested Questions (shown on first load)

- "What are my most critical incidents?"
- "How do I fix a null pointer exception?"
- "What causes deployment failures?"
- "Show me best practices for error handling"
- "How can I reduce incident resolution time?"

## API Endpoint

```
POST /api/chat
```

**Request body:**
```json
{
  "message": "What causes deployment failures?"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "response": "Deployment failures are typically caused by..."
}
```

The API proxies your message to the **You.com AI** and returns the response. You.com's models have strong general coding and DevOps knowledge, making them particularly useful for incident analysis.

## Setup

### Environment Variables

<Tabs defaultValue="env">
  <TabsList>
    <div className="flex items-center rounded-[4px] bg-[#18181b] p-0.5 border border-zinc-800/50">
      <TabsTrigger value="env">.env.local</TabsTrigger>
    </div>
    <TabsCopyButton />
  </TabsList>
  <TabsContent value="env">
    ```bash
    YOU_API_KEY=ydc_your_key_here
    ```
  </TabsContent>
</Tabs>

### Getting a You.com API Key

1. Go to [you.com](https://you.com) and sign in
2. Visit the **API** section in your account settings
3. Generate a new API key (starts with `ydc_`)
4. Add it to your environment variables

> **Note:** The same `YOU_API_KEY` is used by both the AI Chat feature and the Autopsy analysis service.

## Behavior Details

### Auto-scroll

The chat window automatically scrolls to the latest message as new responses arrive.

### Loading State

While the AI is generating a response, a spinning loader appears in the chat window indicating **"Thinking..."**.

### Error Handling

If the AI response fails, an error toast is shown and a fallback message appears in the chat: *"Sorry, I encountered an error. Please try again."*

## Use Cases

### Incident Triage

Ask the AI to help you prioritize: *"Which incidents should I investigate first?"*

### Fix Guidance

Paste an error message and ask: *"What are the common causes of this error and how do I fix it?"*

### Learning

Get explanations for complex concepts: *"What is the difference between a deployment failure and a runtime error?"*
