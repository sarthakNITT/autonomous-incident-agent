# Tutorial: Vercel Deployment

Deploying to Vercel requires configuring environment variables to point to your AIA instance.

## Environment Variables

In your Vercel Project Settings:

*   `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`: `https://your-aia-agent.com/v1/traces`
*   `NEXT_OTEL_VERBOSE`: `0` (unless debugging)

## Serverless Timeouts

Vercel functions can time out. AIA's ingestion is lightweight, but ensure your **Agent** is running on a machine with good uptime (e.g., a VPS or Railway) so it can receive the traces reliably.

## Integration

If using Next.js, Vercel automatically picks up `instrumentation.ts`. No extra configuration is needed beyond the environment variables.
