# Tutorial: Vercel Deployment

Deploying applications monitored by AIA on Vercel requires specific configuration for serverless environments.

## Environment Variables

In your Vercel Project Settings, add the following environment variables:

- `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`: The URL of your AIA Agent (e.g., `https://aia-agent.your-domain.com/v1/traces`).
- `NEXT_OTEL_VERBOSE`: Set to `1` (optional) to debug telemetry issues.

## Vercel OTEL Integration

Vercel offers an automatic OpenTelemetry integartion.

1.  Go to the Vercel Marketplace.
2.  Install the **OpenTelemetry** integration.
3.  Configure it to send traces to your AIA Agent endpoint.

## Serverless Timeout Considerations

Serverless functions on Vercel have a default timeout (usually 10s or 60s).

Ensure your OTLP exporter is configured to flush traces quickly, or use `BatchSpanProcessor` with a short timeout to avoid losing traces when the function freezes.

## Troubleshooting

If traces are missing:
1.  Check the Runtime Logs in the Vercel Dashboard.
2.  Ensure your AIA Agent is publicly accessible (not localhost).
