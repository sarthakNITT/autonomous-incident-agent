# Architecture Overview

For a detailed breakdown of the services, please see [Architecture](./Architecture.mdx).

For a step-by-step guide on how data moves through the system, please see [Data Flow](./DataFlow.mdx).

## Why Microservices?

AIA is split into microservices to allow independent scaling and fault tolerance.

*   **Router**: High throughput, strictly I/O bound.
*   **Autopsy**: CPU and latency bound (LLM calls).
*   **Repro**: High risk, requires isolation (runs untrusted/crashing code).

By separating `Repro`, we ensure that a crashing reproduction script does not bring down the main Agent or Router.
