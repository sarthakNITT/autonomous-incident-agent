# Incident Timeline

The **Incident Timeline** page (`/timeline`) provides a real-time, visual view of every incident's lifecycle — showing exactly which stage each incident is in and auto-refreshing every 10 seconds.

## Overview

The timeline answers the question: *"Where exactly is this incident in the resolution process?"*

Each incident has a **5-stage progress bar** that tracks its journey from detection to resolution, making it easy to see at a glance what's happening across all your deployments.

## Lifecycle Stages

| Stage | Icon | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Detected** | 🔍 | Webhook received, incident record created |
| **Analyzing** | 🔎 | Autopsy AI is analyzing the root cause |
| **Patching** | 📄 | Fix is being generated or applied |
| **Validating** | ⚡ | Fix is being validated |
| **Resolved** | Incident successfully resolved |

> Failed incidents show a separate error state instead of the progress bar.

## Accessing the Timeline

Click **Timeline** in the navigation, or go directly to `/timeline`. Sign-in is required.

## Features

### Real-Time Auto-Refresh

The timeline polls `/api/incidents` every **10 seconds** automatically. A **Live** indicator (pulsing bell) confirms the feed is active.

### Status Filters

Filter incidents by lifecycle stage using the pill buttons:

```
[All (12)] [Detected] [Analyzing] [Patching] [Resolved] [Failed]
```

### Active Stage Indicator

The current stage is **highlighted and enlarged** with a ring animation. A small **"← Now"** label marks the exact current position.

### Elapsed Time

Each incident card shows how long it has been active (in minutes):

```
⏱ 14 min
```

### Repository Badge

If an incident has a linked repository, it's shown as a badge:

```
📦 user/my-repo
```

### PR Link

If a PR was automatically created, a **"View PR"** link appears that opens the GitHub Pull Request:

```
🔀 View PR
```

## Progress Bar Visualization

```
○ ──────── ● ──────── ○ ─────── ○ ────── ○
Detected   Analyzing  Patching  Validating  Resolved
           ← Now
```

The progress line fills proportionally based on the current stage index. Completed steps use the primary foreground color; pending steps are muted.

## API

The timeline reads from:

```
GET /api/incidents
```

This returns all incidents for the authenticated user, including status, timestamps, repo info, and PR links.

## Use Cases

### During Active Incidents

Keep the Timeline open on a secondary monitor during a live incident. Auto-refresh means you'll see status changes within 10 seconds — no manual refreshing needed.

### Team Status Updates

Share a screenshot of the timeline during standup or incident reviews to show the current state of all active incidents.

### Historical Review

Switch the filter to **"Resolved"** to review recently resolved incidents and their elapsed times.
